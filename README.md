## **Description**

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.

## **Table of Contents**

A collection of practice code files for C Programming Language.

## **Technology**

Here all the codes are written in Python and also there are some projects of DJANGO, Voice_Assitant etc.

## **Setup**

1. First you need to set up the Environment

   - **[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) in Your Machine**.
     1. Download Install Msys2
     2. Open Search bar and write Msys2
     3. Open the terminal and paste this command
        - > pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
        - **The above command may change** in future so please check in the website it's available there.
     4. Click windows button and type env and then open environment variable
     5. now you've to find mingw file in that drive where mss were installed and there go inside the bin folder and copy it.
     6. Inside environment variable select path in the user /system(all users) variable click to edit and add new and paste the path there;
     7. Open Command Prompt and write 'gcc' if youre getting and **fatal** error then your gcc is runnign properly or if not running just go to this [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+configure+msys2) link or search how to configure msys2 for c/c++.

2. I've Used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Code Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/) for writing Code

## **Usage**

There in the code files a lot of problems are solved apart from that every small topic's codes are covered so step by step any one can follow from top to bottom.
